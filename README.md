TV Series

Project done by Augusto Carmo to accomplish a Jobsity's Challenge

Considerations
--------

As my personal computer is not powerful enough to run a virtual device, I couldn't manage to test on other Android apis besides my personal Android device.

My device is: Motorola G5 plus - Android 8.1.0

Setup
--------

To setup the project, clone it to your computer and run the application module (:app)

You can find the apk on:
* distribution folder;
